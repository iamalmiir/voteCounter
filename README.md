This code is a simple HTML form that allows a user to input scores for various skills. The form includes separate inputs
for each skill's "Developing" and "Accomplished" scores, as well as a "Total Score" input that updates automatically
based on the scores input for each skill.

The JavaScript code for the form includes several functions, such as limiting the input value for each skill to a
certain range of numbers and disabling one input when the other input has a value. Additionally, the JavaScript code
updates the "Total Score" input whenever a score input changes.

## How to Run

To use this code, you can copy and paste the HTML and JavaScript code into your own HTML file. You can customize the
skill names and score ranges to fit your needs. Note that this code uses jQuery, so you will need to include the jQuery
library in your HTML file as well.
